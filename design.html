				<h3> Introduction  </h3>
				<ul> 
					<li>  This website was designed to be a creative , simple yet interactive design that can showcase  my HTML and CSS & design  my design was is influenced by my favorite color as well as the dark mode feature , that's why I chose to have a dark coloured background as it is easy on the eyes but still allows the content to be bold and clear.</li>

				<h3> 	Menu System:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li> As for my navigation bar I decided to use a hybrid of the plain , hidden and do nothing approach  when designing as I felt they would be the easiest to implement while still looking clean and professional , it is also the design I felt would be most scalable , something I kept in consideration when making the menu systems design was to make sure I am efficient with my space and not make the pages over cluttered while still making the page engaging while maximizing its functionality , more about the designs that influenced me :

				<h3> Create Mobile Responsive Website</h3>
				<ul>
					<li> The idea of creating a mobile-first responsive web design is  to make sure your design fits and looks good on all devices , which more often than not means making a design that will automatically adjust its size according to the its being used on a variety of screen sizes or viewports , this is acheived by setting the css width property to 100% , this makes images scale up and down to perfectly fit the page on every device its being used on .
